		<h1>CSC309 ASSIGNMENT 3: Report</h1>
		<h2>Problem:</h2>
		
		<p>The vast discipline of music can be sub-categorized into two domains: theory and practice.<br>
		During music lessons, children pre-dominantly learn theory, leaving less time for practice with their instructor.<br>
		Children are told to practice their instruments independently at home.<br>
		Children can play exercises at home but they primarily struggle relative pitch and perfect pitch detection. <br>
        The problem is children do not have the resources to practice these two essential skills, and owing to the complexity of manual, independent exercises, nor do they have the motivation.<br>
		Current software solutions available for ear training do not attempt to change this fact.<br>
		Plenty of articles try to motivate students on the importance of ear training, yet fail to do so as well.<br>
		There are no free devices that exist to help verify that a music student is detecting a pitch right.<br>
		There are multiple desktop applications that provide pitch detection but they are complex, dated and expensive.<br>
			
				</p>
				
		<h2>Solution:</h2>
		
		<p>
		We offer an interactive experience that will allow users to learn these techniques in a straightforward, yet exciting, way. <br>
		With interactive online games a student will get instant results and feedback on how well they can identify, distinguish pitch and chords or even reproduce them accurately.<br>
		From these game results we can measure their progress on their own personalized profile.

		</p>

					I like studying computer science, but currently I am not entirely sure which specific CS discipline CS I want to pursue as a career. I still have plenty to explore. In my spare time, I practice drawing, crafting and go hours on end with customizing, modifying, or tweaking things I have access to.

				<td style="max-width:250px;">
					I learned a bit about frontend but my mainly learned backend web programming such as: nodeJS, mongodb and jquery. Since I worked mostly on the UI, I was able to learn a lot of UI and UX techniques to design an aesthetically pleasing web page.

					I like polar bears. I am a food and travel enthusiast. In the future I hope to travel to Malaysia, India, and Japan because they have some of the best food in the world and I would like to eat some authentic food there. Once I graduate, I hope to find a job and pay back my student loans. With enough cash, I will begin to travel around the world.

					I mainly learned about Node.js in this course. I learned more about how the back-end works. I learned about security problems of websites and how to protect against them.

		<h2> Assignment 3 </h2>
		<p><strong> Please refer to sprint backlog and progress backlog </strong></p>
		
		<h2> Stress test reports </h2>
		<p><img src="public/res/imgs/stress-test.jpg" alt="stress test"></p>
		
		<h2> Security Details </h2>
		<p> We used security measures such as hashing and salting to decrease the possibility stolen passwords and emails.<br>
		We also relied on MongoDB to prevent SQL injection to ensure that our data queries are executed safely.<br>
		In terms of security limitations, we have nothing to prevent users from using third party software to increase their scores in game. <br>
		</p>
		
		<h2> Limitations and Improvements </h2>
		<p> Unfortunately due to the lack of resources and personal knowledge we were unable to increase the accuracy of our pitch detection feature. <br>
		If we were to improve our current product, we would:
			<ul>
				<li> Increase Game 4's (pitch detection) accuracy </li>
				<li> Add more games and increase the level of interactivity and user engagement </li>
				<li> Offer more personalization and a higher level of feedback to the user profile </li>
			<ul>
